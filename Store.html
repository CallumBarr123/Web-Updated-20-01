    <p class="card-text">Blue Öyster Cult is the debut studio album by the American rock band Blue Öyster Cult, 
      released in 1972 by Columbia Records. The album featured songs such as "Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll", 
      "Stairway to the Stars", and "Then Came the Last Days of May", all of which the band still plays regularly during its concerts.

      peaking at No. 172. Blue Öyster Cult toured with artists such as the Byrds, Alice Cooper and the Mahavishnu Orchestra to support the album.</p>
